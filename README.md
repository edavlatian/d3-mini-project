# d3-mini-project
Mini project for implementing the D3.js data visualization.

I used D3.js to implement some data visualization. 
There are pie charts to display the breakdown for total sales by branch. 
Bar Charts for current and last month/year data comparisons.
Bar/Line Chart using the C3.js to display data for Current month/year compared to the forcasted sales.
